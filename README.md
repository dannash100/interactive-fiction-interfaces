# Interactive Fiction
## Work in Progress
This project has been a way for me to explore and grow in confidence with full stack javascript development. 
It is inspired by early memories of text-only DOS games, Expecialy "Return to Zork" from which I borrowed the idea of an ASCII map to show navigation options. 

- Work in progress command-line interface and webapp for making text adventure games.
- Games are made through a series of arguments and texts stored and read from a database.
- A web-app displays the map of the world, and scenes can be created by compass directions - keeping track of spatial       relations between scenes.

## Work in Progress
currently working on:
- WebApp for making games with personalized design from ground up. 
- Concept of object to object interactions, and inspecting inventory objects. 
- A more object oriented approach to building scenes so that the concept of an object belonging a scene can be more natural and clean. 
- Moving from SQL to mongoDB and incorporating graphQL.

## Run Command Line Interface
```
node game
```

## Run WebApp
